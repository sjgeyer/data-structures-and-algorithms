# Find Pairs with Given Sum

Write a function that takes in two unsorted arrays and integer `x` and returns all pairs whose sum equals `x`.

## Challenge

Arrays are of length `n` and `m`, and hold only distinct elements.

## Example

Input:

    1: [1, 2, 4, 5, 7]
    2: [5, 6, 3, 4, 8]
    x: 9
    
Output:

    [
        [1, 8],
        [4. 5],
        [5, 4],
    ]
