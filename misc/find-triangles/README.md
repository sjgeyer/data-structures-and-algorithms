# Find all Possible Triangles in an Array
Given an array of positive integers, return the number of triangles that can be formed with three different array elements as three sides of triangles. 

## Challenge
For three sides to form a triangle, the sum of any two sides 
must be greater than the third side.

## Example

Input

    [4, 6, 3, 7]
    
Output

    [
        [3, 4, 6],
        [4, 6, 7],
        [3, 6, 7]
