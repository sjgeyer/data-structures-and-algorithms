# Rotate a Matrix
Write a function that takes in a matrix (array of arrays) and returns the matrix rotated 90 degrees clockwise.

## Challenge
The matrix is 9x9 and will only contain integers.

## Example

Input:

    [
        [1, 1, 1],
        [2, 2, 2],
        [3, 3, 3],
    ]
Output:

    [
        [3, 2, 1],
        [3, 2, 1],
        [3, 2, 1],
    ]
