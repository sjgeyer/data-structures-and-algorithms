# Count Files

You are working with a file structure with only at most 2 files or folder. Each file directory has either one or two folders/files. 

Comparing two file different file directories, create a method that takes in 2 directory structures and compares both and determines weather or not they have the same number of individual files.
 
## Challenge

Create most efficient method possible.

## Example

Input:
          
           [FOLDER]
           /      \
       [File]    [FOLDER]
                  /   \
              [File]   [File]

Output:

    3
