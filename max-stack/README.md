# Max Stack
Write a method that returns the 'biggest' element in a stack.

## Challenge
Create a `MaxStack` class that is a Stack with an additional `getMax()` member function which returns the ‘biggest’ element in the Stack.

The stack will only contain numeric values.

Include `push` and `pop` methods on the `MaxStack` class.

## Example

     stack:  [8]
             [3]
             [1]
             [7]
             [9]
    
    stack.getMax() // => 9
